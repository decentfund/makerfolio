# challenge-hacksummit-MakerDAO


## About MakerDAO
[MakerDAO](https://makerdao.com/) is a decentralized organization dedicated to bringing stability to the crypto economy through Dai, the world's first stablecoin on the Ethereum blockchain. Dai is an asset-backed hard currency that addresses the crypto economyâ€™s problems of volatility with a secure and transparent smart contract platform of permission-less loans.

## Challenges

### Cross Platform Tray Application for CDP Monitoring: Prize 2500 DAI

Create a cross platform (osx/linux/win) tray application that is capable of displaying the current health of a specific CDP. The tool should use the MakerDAO [Query API](https://developer.makerdao.com/dai/1/graphql/) as a data source if possible.

#### The application should:

* provide a highly visible display of both the Liquidation Price and/or the Collateralization Ratio of the chosen CDP
* update every 30 seconds or so
* provide links to the specific CDP page at [https://mkr.tools/cdp/<CDPID>](https://mkr.tools/cdp/)
* have some form of alerting mechanisms (email, pop-up, flashing red icons, etc)

#### Nice to haves:

* Basic graphing of CDP history
* Show text history of CDP transactions
* Support multiple CDPs

#### Super nice to haves:

* Some trending functionality. I.e. Mean time to default using last X days Collateralization Ratio trend

### Really Decentralize Things: Prize 1000 DAI

Package up the [CDP dashboard](https://github.com/makerdao/dai-explorer) or the Oasisdex trading interface into an Electron/Muon wrapper. Must have embedded MetaMask integration and support local parity nodes. Should have no dependencies on the existing web interfaces; contract interaction and local rendering only.

### Mobile upgrade for youvegoteth.github.io: Prize 500 DAI
We would love to be able to send people links to [youvegoteth.github.io](https://youvegoteth.github.io) so users can email Dai through their phones. 

To be successful, a pull request should be accepted by the project owners. Must include making the site mobile friendly so it works in browsers like Toshi or Cipher. The interface may have to be tweaked to make it more responsive as well.

## Judging Criteria
All submissions should use Dai, interact with a CDP, or somehow support the wider MakerDao ecosystem. Code should work and be awesome. We love open source, so we will be taking permissive licenses into account when judging.
